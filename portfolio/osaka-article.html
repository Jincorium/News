      <h1>Osaka Earthquake Hits Residential Areas</h1>
      <h3>Impact, Response, and Future Implications</h3>
      <p>
        On June 10th, a powerful 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck the heart of Osaka,
        shaking buildings and disrupting lives throughout the Kansai region. The quake,
        centered north of the city, caused damage to older infrastructure and led to
        temporary power outages across several districts.

        Authorities responded swiftly. Emergency services were deployed within minutes,
        ensuring that schools, transit lines, and public spaces were evacuated and
        assessed for safety. Despite the magnitude, casualties were minimal thanks to
        strict building codes and effective public preparedness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experts are now assessing long-term structural impacts and emphasizing the
        importance of continued investment in earthquake readiness. Osaka's experience
        serves as a reminder of the region's vulnerability and resilience.
